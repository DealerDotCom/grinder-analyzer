To run the automated tests you need the following:

 * A Bash environment.  Grinder Analyzer can be run on Windows, but the
   testing needs to happen in Linux or possibly (untested) OS X.

 * Java 5 and Java 6 need to be installed in /usr/local

 * Jython 2.2.1 and 2.5 need to be installed in /usr/local

 * Ant must be installed and on the path

 * Current user must have write access to /usr/local

 * the JAVA_HOME environment variable must point to /usr/local/java

 * $JAVA_HOME/bin must be on the path.  There must be no other 'java'
   executable on the path before the one at $JAVA_HOME/bin
