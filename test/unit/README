To run unit tests:

   * Be sure you are running as Jython (not Python) unit tests.
  
   * Running from within the IDE (Eclipse/Pydev) is probably the
     easiest way to go.

   * Compile and create the GrinderAnalyzer .jar file via ant
     using the 'ant clean pkg' command.

   * Add all jars in the lib directory to your Jython classpath.
   
   * if running pyunit from Eclipse, add the test/unit dir to the PYTHONPATH

   * Make a symlink from ../../conf to ./conf
